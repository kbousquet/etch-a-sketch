## Project: Etch-a-Sketch
Browser-based implementation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

This is my second **JS** project. Click [here](https://kbousquet.github.io/etch-a-sketch) for the **Live version** of the webpage.
**The benefits I got from this project include:**
* Learned the basics of CSS grid
* Gained more experience using Flexbox
* Deepened understanding of DOM manipulation
* Learned about Event Delegation
* More practice with using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript together
